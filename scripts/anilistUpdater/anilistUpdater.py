mpv-anilist-updater: Automatically updates your AniList based on the file you just watched in MPV.

This script parses anime filenames, determines the correct AniList entry, and updates your progress
or status accordingly.
"""

# Configuration options for anilistUpdater (set in anilistUpdater.conf):
#
# DIRECTORIES: List or comma/semicolon-separated string. The directories the script will work on. Leaving it empty will make it work on every video you watch with mpv. Example: DIRECTORIES = ["D:/Torrents", "D:/Anime"]
#
# UPDATE_PERCENTAGE: Integer (0-100). The percentage of the video you need to watch before it updates AniList automatically. Default is 85 (usually before the ED of a usual episode duration).
#
# SET_COMPLETED_TO_REWATCHING_ON_FIRST_EPISODE: Boolean. If true, when watching episode 1 of a completed anime, set it to rewatching and update progress.
#
# UPDATE_PROGRESS_WHEN_REWATCHING: Boolean. If true, allow updating progress for anime set to rewatching. This is for if you want to set anime to rewatching manually, but still update progress automatically.
#
# SET_TO_COMPLETED_AFTER_LAST_EPISODE_CURRENT: Boolean. If true, set to COMPLETED after last episode if status was CURRENT.
#
# SET_TO_COMPLETED_AFTER_LAST_EPISODE_REWATCHING: Boolean. If true, set to COMPLETED after last episode if status was REPEATING (rewatching).
